To create a Python server that receives JSON data in a POST request, you can use the Flask web framework, which simplifies building web applications in Python. Here's an example:
pip install Flask

Next, create a Python script to set up the server and handle the JSON POST request:index.py

Inside the handle_request function, we use request.json to access the JSON data sent in the request body. If the JSON data is not present or invalid, we return a JSON response with an error message and a 400 status code (Bad Request).

To run the server, execute the Python script, and it will start a web server listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000. You can send a POST request with JSON data to http://localhost:3000/api/data, and the server will receive the data, log it, and send a JSON response confirming that the data was received successfully.
